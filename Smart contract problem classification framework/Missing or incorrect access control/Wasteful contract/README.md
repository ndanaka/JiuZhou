# Prodigal contract
We call a contract in which anyone can withdraw a deposit a prodigal contract, and the reason for this problem is that the contract does not have access control over the verification of withdrawals, allowing anyone to withdraw ethers from the contract.

In some cases, the problem is caused by misspelled constructors.
