# False inheritance
Solidity supports inheritance, and multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance makes the order of contract inheritance important, Solidity's multiple inheritance is similar to python. Incorrect contract inheritance can cause many problems:
1. Hide state variables
2. Incorrect inheritance order causes the contract to function differently than expected
