# JiuZhou(九州)
**Jiuzhou** is a collection of statistics and classification of Ethereum smart contracts. 

**Jiuzhou** follows the *IEEE Standard Classification for Software Anomalies* (1044-2009) and classifies Ethereum smart contract bugs into 8 categories with a total of 50 bugs. 

**Jiuzhou** provides a brief introduction and test cases for each bug. This helps smart contract developers or researchers understand the current state of security of Ethereum and obtain benchmark data sets for testing smart contract analysis tools.
